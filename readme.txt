== Changelog ==

#### [0.1](http://hackadelic.com/featuring-new-wordpress-tweaks-bundle-and-wordpress-tweaks-composer-tool "Brand new plugin: Hackadelic WordPress Tweaks, featuring Tweaks Bundle Composer")

Initial public release

== Description ==

Enables several blog features: Activates CodePress syntax coloring editor, enables shortcodes in sidebars etc.

>### Note:###
>
> Because not all tweaks are applicable on every blog (and some tweaks are definitely up to personal taste), the basic plugin edition includes only the tweaks that *most* people should find useful and unobjectionable: It activates the CodePress syntax coloring editor in the dashboard, and enables shortcodes in sidebars.
>
> *For more tweaks and maximum performance, create your own **free custom plugin edition** with the **[WordPress Online Tweaks Composer](http://hackadelic.com/wordpress-online-tools/wordpress-tweaks-composer "Free WordPress Online Tweaks Composer Tool")**.*

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I use the plug-in? =

Just activate the plugin, and the tweaks will be applied. For example, your plugin and theme editors will be upgraded to syntax coloring, if the CodePress tweak is included.

= What about options? =

Every tweak is simple and self-contained. The only "option" is to have it, or not have it. For maximum performance, instead of the "usual" options page in *your* dashboard, another approach has been chosen:

Instead of wasting run-time performance on querying and evaluating options for every possible tweaks, a streamlined custom edition of the plugin can be generated with the [WordPress Tweaks Composer](http://hackadelic.com/wordpress-online-tools/wordpress-tweaks-composer "Free WordPress Online Tweaks Composer Tool") online tool. This way, both maximum performance and the comfort of selecting tweaks in a convenient GUI are preserved.

= I love your work, are you available for hire? =

Yes I am. See [my services](http://hackadelic.com/services "WordPress Expert Services") and [contact me](http://hackadelic.com/contact "Contact WordPress Expert") to "talk turkey" :)
